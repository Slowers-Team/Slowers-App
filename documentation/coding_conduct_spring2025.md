# Coding conduct

- Development is done in feature branches
- A few small commits in one branch
- Branches are alive only short time
- Feature branches are first merged into `development` branch before merging into `main` branch
- Pull requests into `development` branch are accepted only after they pass a code review by another team member; the reviewer will merge the branch if accepted
- A reasonable amount of technical debt is acceptable when initially coding a feature, as long as the code will be refactored at a later time
