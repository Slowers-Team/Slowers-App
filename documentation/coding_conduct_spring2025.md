# Coding conduct

- Development is done in feature branches.
- Each feature branch has only few small commits
- Feature branches are alive only short time.
- Feature branches are first merged into `development` branch before merging into `main` branch.
- Pull requests into `development` branch are accepted only after they pass a code review by another team member.
- A reasonable amount of technical debt is acceptable when initially coding a feature, as long as the code will be refactored at a later time.
