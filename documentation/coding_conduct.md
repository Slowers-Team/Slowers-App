# Coding conduct

- development is done in feature branches
- feature branches are initiated from GitHub issues
- feature branches are first merged into `development` branch before merging into `main` branch
- pull requests into `development` branch are accepted only after they pass a code review by another team member
- a reasonable amount of technical debt is acceptable when initially coding a feature, as long as the code will be refactored at a later time
